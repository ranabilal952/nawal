                            <p style="">It's hard to imagine a better symbol of America than the Statue of Liberty. While there are plenty of ways to see the famous lady, a ride on the free Staten Island Ferry is the cheapest. This New York City sightseeing option does not stop at the attraction, though; if you want to go inside, you will need to pay $12 to $21.50 (depending on age) for a Crown Reserve Ticket from Statue Cruises. The ticket includes a cruise to Liberty Island and Ellis Island, as well as crown access. There's also the Pedestal Reserve Ticket option, which only covers entry to the pedestal area and the Statue of Liberty Museum in its $9 to $18.50 per person fee.</p>

                            <p style="">One of America's greatest natural wonders is the Grand Canyon, a massive canyon carved by the Colorado River millions of years ago. Some of the park's most popular activities include hiking the Rim Trail, taking a mule trip to the bottom of the canyon and whitewater rafting on the Colorado River. The best time of year to visit is in the spring or fall. Both seasons offer milder weather and thinner crowds than summer while avoiding winter's snowy conditions. To enter the park, expect to pay $35 per vehicle or $20 per person if arriving by bike, on foot or via one of several free shuttle buses. Keep in mind, some shuttles only operate during select months.</p>

                            <p style="">For a truly otherworldly landscape, head to breathtaking Zion National Park in southwestern Utah. This national park is filled with red rocks, canyons, waterfalls and hanging gardens, many of which can be viewed while hiking, canyoneering or horseback riding. Some of the protected area's most popular hikes include the Angels Landing trail (with sheer drop-offs on either side and chains for hikers to cling to) and the Narrows (which involves trekking through a river inside a slot canyon). The park is busiest from March through October, so consider arriving early or using the free shuttle to avoid long lines at the entrance. Admission costs $35 per vehicle or $20 per person entering on foot or via bike.

                            <p style="">When you think of Seattle, chances are the Space Needle immediately comes to mind. Designed for the 1962 World's Fair (which featured a space theme), the futuristic structure was renovated in 2018 to include the Skyrisers experience (where travelers' feet dangle as they lean over the city) and the world's only rotating glass floor. Less adventurous visitors who want to enjoy panoramic views of the city, Puget Sound and Mount Rainier can take in their surroundings through floor-to-ceiling windows. The 605-foot-tall Space Needle is open every day, and tickets start at $32.50 for adults and $24.50 for children. Exact fees vary depending on the season.</p>

                        <h1 class="text-center">Hollywood Sign</h1>
                            <p style="">An icon of America's golden age of movies, Los Angeles' Hollywood Sign is one of the first things you see when flying into the city. Built in 1923, the 45-foot-tall sign was originally spelled "Hollywoodland" to promote a housing development by the same name. In 1949, the LA fixture dropped its last four letters to spell "Hollywood" instead. For incredible views of the sign, hike the West Trail in Griffith Park to its gates or sign up for a horseback riding excursion from Sunset Ranch Hollywood. Other places with phenomenal Hollywood Sign vistas include the Hollywood Bowl Overlook on Mulholland Drive and the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue.</p>

                            <p style="">Famous for its plentiful casinos, luxe resorts and superb live entertainment (think: magic shows and Cirque du Soleil performances), this portion of Las Vegas Boulevard brings visitors from around the world looking for fun. Some of the Las Vegas Strip's most popular activities include admiring the Fountains of Bellagio, enjoying a gondola ride on The Venetian Resort Las Vegas' canals, watching the volcano erupt at The Mirage and riding The Big Apple Coaster at New York-New York Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. The Strip is also where you'll find the bulk of Las Vegas' can't-miss restaurants, as well as The Shops at Crystals and The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. To avoid uncomfortable daytime temperatures in the 100s, skip a summer trip.</p>

                        <h1 class="text-center">Times Square</h1>
                            <p style="">Few spots embody the bright lights and hustle and bustle of the Big Apple like Times Square. Times Square is a spectacle thanks to its gigantic illuminated billboards, constant stream of people, plethora of hotels and abundant shops. Portions of this Broadway, West 45th Street and Seventh Avenue intersection are pedestrian-only, so you can enjoy people-watching from tables and chairs. If you want to catch a Broadway show, head to the TKTS booth to score discounted theater tickets. Times Square is also the spot to go to watch the ball drop every New Year's Eve. While the attraction always seems to be busy, summer tends to be especially crowded (and hot). Plan on visiting in the fall, winter or spring when kids are back in school.</p>

                            <p style="">Spread across three states, Yellowstone National Park features more than 2 million acres filled with wildlife and jaw-dropping natural wonders like Old Faithful, Lower Falls and Yellowstone Lake. The park is open year-round and offers different experiences during each season. You'll find the most tourists in the summer, while winter offers more elbow room at attractions because most roads are closed. For in-park accommodations, you'll have your pick of up to nine properties (options vary depending on the season). There are also multiple campsites available.</p>

                            <p style="">Nicknamed America's Mountain, Pikes Peak inspired author Katharine Lee Bates to write "America the Beautiful." Those who want to reach the top of this 14,000-foot-tall mountain, which sits about 30 miles west of Colorado Springs, can do so by hiking, biking or driving on Pikes Peak Highway. During the 19-mile journey to the summit, you'll enjoy fantastic views of lakes, mountains and local wildlife. . Access to the highway costs $15 per adult and $5 per child or $50 per car. Although the area generally experiences mild weather throughout the year, the summit's temperature is typically 30 to 40 degrees cooler than Colorado Springs, so dress accordingly.</p>

                            <p style="">One of the most popular tourist attractions in San Antonio is the River Walk. Also called Paseo del Rio, this 15-mile waterway is the largest urban ecosystem in the U.S. You can choose to explore the River Walk, which features various shops and restaurants, on foot or by river barge. The free attraction also offers easy access to other top sites, such as the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. Because San Antonio offers comfortable temperatures (averages throughout the seasons hover between the high 30s and mid-70s) and more than 250 days of sunshine annually, you're nearly guaranteed superb weather when you visit.</p>

                            <p style="">Few U.S. structures are as well-known as the Washington Monument. Built in 1884 to honor former president George Washington, this landmark stands more than 555 feet above Washington, D.C.'s National Mall, where you'll find other iconic attractions like the Lincoln Memorial and the U.S. Capitol. The Washington Monument is the world's tallest stone structure and obelisk. Though access to the top of the monument is unavailable while repairs are made to the structure's elevators, you can admire it for free from the ground. Spring is a wonderful (albeit crowded) time to visit thanks to the National Mall's cherry blossoms. Still, fall offers comparable weather without as many tourists.</p>
