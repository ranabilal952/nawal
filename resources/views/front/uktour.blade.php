                            <p style="">Stonehenge, 10 miles north of the historic city of Salisbury on Salisbury Plain, is Europe's best-known prehistoric monument. It's so popular that visitors need to purchase a timed ticket in advance to guarantee entry. Exhibitions at the excellent Stonehenge visitor center set the stage for a visit, explaining through audio-visual experiences and more than 250 ancient objects how the megaliths were erected between 3000 and 1500 BC, and sharing information about life during this time. After walking around the various viewing points adjacent to these enormous stones, visit the authentic replicas of Neolithic Houses to see the tools and implements of everyday Neolithic life as volunteers demonstrate skills from 4,500 years ago.</p>

                            <p style="">Prison, palace, treasure vault, observatory, and menagerie: the Tower of London has done it all and it's one of the top attractions in London. Widely considered the most important building in England, there's enough to see and do at this World Heritage Site to keep visitors busy for hours. The centerpiece of this Thames-side fortress is the White Tower. Built in 1078 by William the Conqueror, it's home to amazing exhibits, such as Line of Kings, the world's oldest visitor attraction, established in 1652 with a remarkable display of royal armor. Other highlights include the impressive Crown Jewels exhibition, classic Yeoman Warder Tours, the Royal Mint, and exhibits and displays regarding prisoners and executions. </p>

                            <p style="">If you only have time to visit one smaller city in England, you couldn't do much better than Bath. This remarkably beautiful city in Somerset boasts more fantastic tourist attractions than you could hope to visit in a day. While most famous for the magnificent 2,000-year-old Roman Baths built around the city's rejuvenating hot springs, it's equally well known for its honey-colored Georgian Townhouses, such as those located on Royal Crescent. Some 500 of the city's buildings are considered of historical or architectural importance, a fact that has resulted in the entire city being granted World Heritage status.</p>

                            <p style="">With collections of antiquities that are among the world's finest, the British Museum holds more than 13 million artifacts from Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, the Roman Empire, China, and Europe. The most famous ancient artifacts are the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon in Athens, as well as the famous Rosetta Stone. But there are many other outstanding pieces on show here that help make this one of the best places to visit in London. The Ancient Egyptian collection is the largest outside of Cairo, and the hoard of Roman silver dating from the fourth century known as the Mildenhall Treasure, unearthed in Suffolk in 1942, is nothing short of spectacular.

                            <p style="">The magnificent York Minster is second in importance in the Church of England only to the cathedral at Canterbury. It stands in the center of historic York, surrounded by half-timbered homes and shops, medieval guildhalls, and churches. In turn, York's romantic streets are surrounded by three miles of magnificent town walls that you can walk atop for spectacular views over the city and its surroundings. While here, visit the National Railway Museum, one of England's most visited tourist attractions. York is also a good base from which to explore northeast England, in particular the rugged beauty of the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors.</p>

                            <p style="">Located in Upton, just over a mile north of Chester city center, Chester Zoo is England's most visited attraction outside of London and is one of the best places to visit in England for families. The more than 11,000 animals living in this 125-acre site represent about 400 different species. But the zoo's appeal reaches beyond just animal lovers, with prizewinning landscaped gardens also available for visitors to enjoy. You can tour these extensive grounds on the zoo's monorail system to reach highlights that include Chimpanzee Island, a penguin pool, and Europe's largest tropical house. There's plenty of other fun things to do at Chester Zoo, too, so expect to easily spend a day enjoying this top-rated tourist attraction.</p>

                            <p style="">Covering some 900 square miles, Lake District National Park is a must-visit destination for travelers to England. With 12 of the country's largest lakes and more than 2,000 miles of rights of way waiting to be explored, there's little wonder the region continues to inspire, with its magnificent views and scenery straight out of a painting. Other things to do include visiting the park's many fells, including Scafell Pike (3,210 feet), the highest mountain in England. Be sure to also spend time exploring some of the lovely little towns and villages dotted throughout the region, such as Grasmere. Better still, hop aboard a tour boat excursion across Lake Windermere and Ullswater, and you'll be rewarded with some of the best scenery anywhere in the country.</p>

                            <p style="">Located in the heart of the historic city that bears its name, Canterbury Cathedral (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) is home to the Archbishop of Canterbury and is the cradle of English Christianity. It all started when St. Augustine converted the pagan Anglo Saxons here in 597 when he became the first bishop. Excellent guided tours of the cathedral are available, and for a truly memorable experience, consider booking an overnight stay in the grounds at Canterbury Cathedral Lodge. But there's much more to this beautiful medieval city than just its cathedral. Canterbury is also a popular cultural and entertainment destination with great shopping,as well as attractions such as those focused on Chaucer's medieval England and the city's Roman past.</p>

                            <p style="">The incredible Eden Project is a collection of unique artificial biomes containing an amazing collection of plants from around the world. Located in a reclaimed quarry in Cornwall, this spectacular botanical gardens complex consists of huge domes that look rather like massive igloo-shaped greenhouses. Each of these impressive (and futuristic-looking) buildings houses thousands of different plant species in tropical and Mediterranean environments. As well as these stunning displays of plant life, the Eden Project hosts numerous arts and music events year-round. If you're able to extend your visit, consider booking a stay at the on-site hostel, or enjoy a meal in one of its restaurants. Adventure activities such as ziplining and giant swings are also available.</p>

                            <p style="">The Cotswolds cover some 787 square miles and encompass parts of some of England's prettiest counties: Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Worcestershire, and Warwickshire. And all of it begs to be explored. Designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty due to its rare limestone grassland habitats and old-growth beech woodlands, the beauty of the Cotswolds has much to do with its quaint villages and towns, such as Castle Combe, Chipping Norton, and Tetbury. One of the best routes is along the Cotswold Way, a 102-mile footpath with spectacular views of the Severn Valley and the Vale of Evesham. This route runs the length of the Cotswolds, and can be picked up pretty much anywhere you visit.</p>

                            <p style="">Displaying one of the most comprehensive collections of paintings in the world, the National Gallery is London's second-most visited museum. The collections, which present an almost complete cross-section of European painting from 1260 until 1920, are especially strong in the Dutch Masters and the Italian Schools of the 15th and 16th centuries. In the Italian galleries, look for works by Fra Angelico, Giotto, Bellini, Botticelli, Correggio, Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, and especially for Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna and Child with St. Anne and John the Baptist, Raphael's The Crucifixion, and The Entombment by Michelangelo. In the German and Dutch galleries are works by Dürer, van Dyck, Frans Hals, Vermeer, and Rembrandt.</p>

                            <p style="">If you're looking for a truly memorable English excursion for the whole family - and one that offers a fascinating insight into life in medieval times - you couldn't do much better than visit Warwick Castle. Located in the beautiful city of Warwick on the River Avon, this impressive fortress has dominated the landscape and history of the region for more than 900 years. Today, it serves as a backdrop to medieval-themed events and reenactments, from jousting festivals to fairs and concerts. Warwick is also great base from which to explore the Cotswolds, as well as nearby towns such as Stratford-upon-Avon, famous as the birthplace of William Shakespeare. Bigger city destinations, including Liverpool, as well as Birmingham and Coventry, are an easy drive away.
