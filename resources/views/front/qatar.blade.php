                            <p style="">The Museum of Islamic Art is situated in the bosom of a frame of tranquil, translucent aqua. As you go forward you will pass a bridge across the water and consider yourself being drawn in by the wonderful emergence of the museum. The white edifice has acute, boxed endings, and remains alone on the water. In the sunlight, the museum seems to dazzle with glow and its compelling atmosphere is augmented. When you walk inside, you will be stunned by the complication of its interior, which strongly contrasts with the plainness of its exterior. </p>

Reaching on top, satisfy your eyes on the sights. The edifice itself is totally awesome and lovely in its own way.

                            <p style="">The National Museum of Qatar is so intricate in its design that anybody can thought it mistakenly an origami masterpiece. The white edifice has edgy and bending edges and, on an architectural level, seems nearly unattainable. The building is at present under construction and is slowly making the architect’s astounding design a reality. The museum’s design is stimulated by the desert rose; a natural wonder formed by crystals in particular climates. The architect believed that the desert rose illustrate the course of time, and craved to materialize this idea in the design of the edifice.

                            <p style="">The Al Wakra museum is a place that has some of the greatest architecture in Qatar.

                            <p style="">Al Jassasiya is one of the most crooked sites in Qatar. Its secret lies in its petroglyphs–tricky and impenetrable carvings in the stone that are unbelievably exceptional. People believed that these carvings are some sort of symbol, and they feature figures that illustrate animals, boats, and daisies. Many of the shapes and symbols are not identifiable, and their true meanings remain indistinguishable. It is believed that these symbols are hundreds of years old, making their conservation really remarkable. </p>

                            <p style="">In the center of nowhere, sand extends ahead of you for miles before this grim castle comes into sight. The fortress’ charm lies in its seclusion, and you can reach it on camel-back at an unhurried pace. As you stand under this castle, you will feel a sense of being attached to a sensational and potential history. To assist you to realize the history of the fortress better, Al-Zubarah often holds displays of the site. This castle will have you feeling slighted; you will feel that there is something amazing about understanding your own impertinence.</p>

                            <p style="">The Doha desert lies in most cases intact and should be a portion of your tour to Qatar. Very little is as wonderful as miles and miles of primitive, glossy sand. The charm of the desert sights will leave you feeling tiny and in awe of the immensity of this strange landscape. The sand is compact, the sand dunes are revolving, and this fantastic desert landscape can be tasted on any desert safari day. Rev your engines and stir up the dirt to experience the glamour of the desert directly.</p>

                            <p style="">“Grand” is an appropriate narration of this mosque. The outer part is cozily frightening, with the outlook of a secure fortress, while the inner part is awesome. The domed roof is high above your head, with rock white pillars throughout and simple candelabra hanging above you. This space itself is attractively massive, and you will become spellbound by the architecture. At night, the mosque’s outer part is specifically beautiful, as it is enlightened with purple lights.</p>

                            <p style="">The Katara Mosque is located in the middle of the Katara Cultural Village site, where some of the stunningly beautiful architecture in the Middle East is just waiting to be seen. The design of the Katara Mosque is not like the typical mosques in Qatar. The edifice is a mosaic of mainly blue tiles, with a glimpse of red and yellow. You will be blown away by the tricky designs and the equally complicated interior. Consorting the mosque are three spiked columns elevating for the sky. The contrast between these overcoming structures and the charm of the mosaic walls is really attractive.</p>

                            <p style="">One of the greatest beloved sites among walkers, cyclists, and joggers, the Doha Corniche is an oceanfront promenade that revamped Doha’s shoreline in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While it is a famous place for exercising in the dawn, it attracts various types of people who are seeking for remarkable sights of the city’s skyline. During the day, you can appreciate the unbelievable colors of Doha’s bay; in the evening, you can enjoy a stunning view of a fantastic sunset; and at night, you will be able to behold the wonderful colors of the city’s lights gleaming off the tranquil water.</p>

                            <p style="">The Souq Waqif is situated only a few minutes away from the Corniche. Famous as the social heart of Doha, Souq Waqif is a good place to shop, wander, eating delicious foods or just passing time idly in one of the fascinating local cafes. The site is usually congested with visitors strolling around the lanes to appreciate the architectural edifices and the many cultural stores offering everything from embroideries, spices, perfumes, and oud (fantastic incense made of agarwood). It’s also a famous site to shop for unparalleled souvenirs for the people back at home.
